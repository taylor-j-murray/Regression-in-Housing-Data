# Personal Notes



## Facts and Definitions from Measure Theory:

*  A $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ over a set $\Omega$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ such that $\Sigma$ satisfies the following:

- $\Sigma$ contains $\Omega$
- is closed under complements, 
- and closed under **countable** unions.

* A measurable space is a pair $(X,\mathcal{F})$ where $X$ is a set and $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of $X$.

* A measure is a function $\mu: \mathcal{F} \to [0,\infty]$ on a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{F})$, where $\mu$ satisfies:
- $\mu(\empty) = 0$
- $\mu$ is additive over countable pairwise disjoint collections of elements in $\mathcal{F}$

* The Radon-Nikodym Theorem states: for $\sigma$-finite measure $\mu$ and $\tau$ on a measurable space $(X,\mathcal{G})$ if $\mu << \tau$, then there exists a measurable function $f: X \to [0,\infty)$ such that for every $A\in\mathcal{G}$, we have 

$$ \mu(A) = \int_A f(x) ~ d\tau(x).$$

## Normal Continuous Distributions:

* A *probability space* is a triple $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, where 

- $\Omega$ is the sample space i.e the set of all possible outcomes.
- $\mathcal{F}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$, sometimes this space is called the events and an element is called an event. 
- $\mathbb{P} : \mathcal{F} \to [0,1]$ is a probability measure. Recall, a measure is non-negative, takes the empty set to 0, , and is additive on countable collections of **pairwise disjoint** elements of $\mathcal{F}$. The
*probability* in probability measure simply means that the measure of $\Omega$ is 1.  

* A *random variable* on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is a measurable function $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ where $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ is a probability space. $X$ is said to be continuous if its push-forward measure $\mu_X = \mathbb{P} \circ X^{-1}: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ onto $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(R))$ satisfies that $\mu_X << \lambda$. Here $\mathcal{B}(R)$ is the *Borel $\sigma$-algebra* on $\mathbb{R}$, which is the $\sigma$-algebra on $\mathbb{R}$ generated by the open subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$, and $<<$$ denotes *absolute continuity*. Recall that for two measures $\mu$ and $\tau$ on a measurable space $(Y, \mathcal{G})$, we say $\mu << \tau$ if and only if for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$, if $\tau(A) = 0$, then $\mu(A) = 0$.  

* Given a continuous random variable $X: \Omega \to \mathbb{R}$ on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, the Radon-Nikodym Theorem says that there is a measurable function $ f: \mathbb{R} \to [0,\infty)$ such that for every Borel set $B\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ one has 

$$\mu_X(A) = \mathbb{P}(X^{-1}(A)) = \int_A f(x) ~d\lambda(x) $$,

where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}$. The function $f$ is called the probability density function of $X$.

* A *normal distribution* defines a probability measure $(\mathbb{R}, \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}))$ that is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure whose Radon-Nikodym derivative is of the form 

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right), $$

where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. A few facts about f(x):

- symmetric about the mean
- a single local max at x=$\mu$


## Normal Discrete Distributions




## Methods for dealing with outliers:

### Z-Score Method:

$$Z = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$

* $Z$ is the Z-score of a value X.
* $\mu$ is the average of the population in which X belongs.
* $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population in which X belongs.

#### How to Interpret:

$Z-score > 3$ or $Z-score <-3$ usually suggests an outlier in that the Z-score is more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean.

#### Pros and Cons:



### Interquartile Range (IQR):


### Local Outlier Factor:


### Isolation Forest:



### Mahalanobis Distance
